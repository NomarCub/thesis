# Car traffic control and overtaking system in Unity

This repository contains the project I did for my thesis in the 2019 fall semester for my [BSc in computer engineering at BME](https://www.vik.bme.hu/en/education/programs/).  
You can find the abstract in English [here](abstract.md) and the thesis itself in Hungarian under [releases](https://github.com/NomarCub/thesis/releases).

Originally called "Developing of self driving car in Unity", the final project can be more accurately described by the current title; it is a proof of concept car traffic control and overtaking system made in the Unity 3D engine using C#.
